# Theatre-Seat-Booking


## The "Theatre-Seat-Booking" project is a simple command-line application built using Python that allows users to book seats for a movie theatre. Here is a summary of the project:

The application prompts the user to enter the name of the movie and the number of seats they want to book. The user can then choose the seats they want to book from a seating chart displayed on the screen.
The application checks if the selected seats are available and, if they are, confirms the booking and updates the seating chart accordingly.
If the selected seats are already booked, the application prompts the user to choose different seats.
